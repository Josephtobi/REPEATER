REPEATER

Repeater Entry Provides Extremely Accurate and True Estimates of Range
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The repeater database to end all repeater databases. 

Goals/Values:
-------------
1. Provide information for Amateur Radio (and possible other) operators
to conveniently find known-good information about the radio resources
near them.
2. This information is provided without cost, copyright, or other
restrictions. It will remain open and shareable, in keeping with various
ham radio and hacker cultural traditions.
3. The database should hold all known information about a node. If you
find that you have information about a node and no way to enter it,
please open an issue, or better yet, a pull request adding the format. 
However, for now, network information should not be included.
4. Quality of data trumps all (because that's the weak part of the existing databases).



Deployments
-----------
This repo will automatically deploy the `main` branch to https://repeater.m17project.org
